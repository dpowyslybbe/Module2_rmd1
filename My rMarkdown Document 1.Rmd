# Level 1 header

## R Markdown

### Level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [Google](http://www.google.co.uk)

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Here is an example of an indented list:

* Breakfast
    - Weetabix
    - Milk
    - Banana
        + No skin
        + No rind
    - Raisins
* Lunch
    - Sandwich
        - Bread
        - Tomato
        - Cheese
        - Ham
* Supper
    - Spaghetti Bolgnaise
    - Eclaire

Here is an example of a blockquote:

> What on earth is happening here?
> I dunno boss
> Oh well then

Here is an example of a nested blockquote

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert tables

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 rows of Cars data set")

```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$
